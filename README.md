# \<paper-carousel\>

This repository contains an updated version of the [paper-carousel Polymer element by Redbility](https://github.com/Redbility/paper-carousel). The element has been updated from a Polymer 1/2 element to a Polymer 3 element.

## Install the Polymer-CLI

First, make sure you have the [Polymer CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polymer-cli) and npm (packaged with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)) installed. Run `npm install` to install your element's dependencies, then run `polymer serve` to serve your element locally.

## Viewing Your Element

```
$ polymer serve
```
Ctrl + click on the "reusable components" url. This url should look something like this:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8081/components/paper-carousel/
```

## Running Tests

```
$ polymer test
```

## ToDo
* Improve readability by splitting up large functions into smaller functions
* Add more tests
* When looping show first elements directly after last element
